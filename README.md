# React Native and Firebase Authentication

## Setting up the Project

```
react-native init ProjectName
cd ProjectName
```

Here we want to manage the state of the application using redux.

In the current project folder instal react-redux.

```
npm install --save react-redux redux
```


## Setting up firebase console for the project

Once you've completed setting up React Native Firebase you can now use the library within your JavaScript code like any other node module.

Head over to Web setup in the project.
Select the script . copy it to the react native app.
